---------------------------------OScelot BUG LOG--------------------------------

CP 1:
- System exception handlers were being swapped around
  + FIX: There was a typo in x86_desc.S
  + Time to fix: 3 hours
- Problems initializing keyboard
  + FIX: We were writing to the wrong port.
  + Time to fix: 2 hours

CP 2:
- Terminal would only accept one keypress and then nothing else would be
printed to the terminal afterwards
  + FIX: Forgot to send EOI and re-enable interrupts afterwards
  + Time to fix: 1 hour
- After filling the terminal with two lines worth of text, if I attempted
to type on the next line, the previous line would be copied and I would get
repeating lines of text.
  + FIX: Added conditionals that would change the buffer offset that would be
         sent to _print_to_terminal()
  + Time to fix: 6 hours
- Multiple terminal bugs
  + FIXes:
    * Type more than 160 chars into buffer and previous line
      would print to the screen
    * terminal_write() would not print the first two characters in the buffer
- Multiple filesys bugs
  + FIXes:
    * page faults
    * read_dentry_by_name was missing an incrementer in the while loop
    * filenames passed as uint8_t* caused a compiler error. Cast as int8_t*

CP 3:
- syscalls had type errors
  + FIX: Cast to the appropriate types.
- 2D arrays in paging?
  + FIX: switch to 1D arrays
  + Revealed deeper error: we weren't flushing the TLB properly.
- The syscall interrupt was mapped to IDT[0x79] instead of IDT[0x80]
  + FIX: fix the IDT entry
- General page faults after calling the halt syscall
- Page faulting after trying to open a 7th shell
  + FIX: implement the maximum shell limit

CP 4:
- Calling cat on a file after calling cat previously would not work.
  + FIX: the args field in our PCB was not being cleared properly before
         being updated.
- Executing RTC from the shell mangled the fish and pingpong user programs
  + FIX: Close the RTC file after opening and trying to execute it!
- General Protection Fault occurred when a command of longer than 32 characters
  was entered.
  + FIX: Add a check in execute that returned -1 if the command was
         longer than 32 chars.
- Pressing backspace after the line wrapped doesn't work as intended
  + FIX: We fixed the terminal offset.
  + NOTE: This change was later overhauled by another more robust set of
          functions that no longer needed this fix.

CP 5:
- Compiler warnings in parameters to memcpy
  + FIX: Cast all params to char*
- Multiple terminals did not play nicely with each other.
  + FIX: Moving from the RTC driving the scheduler to the PIT cleared up most
         of the issues that existed.
- Small bugs in grep and hello
  + FIX: make terminal_read read the newline character at the end of the buffer.
